# Auto-Caption Images with WD14 Tagger (`wd14_captioner`)

This plugin uses the WD14 tagger (from the kohya-ss/sd-scripts) to automatically generate Danbooru-style tags for image datasets. It is ideal for preparing high-quality captions for datasets used in fine-tuning Stable Diffusion or similar models.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Image Dataset

Upload a dataset containing image files. The dataset must include an image column (default: `"image"`). You can configure the name of this column via the **Image Field** parameter.

> The model supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.webp` formats.

## Step 2: Configure Plugin Parameters

Use the parameters panel to control the tag generation behavior:

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Image Field` | Dataset column that contains the image files |
| `Tag Confidence Threshold` | Minimum confidence score for a tag to be included |
| `General Threshold` | Optional threshold specifically for general (non-character) tags |
| `Character Threshold` | Optional threshold specifically for character tags |
| `ONNX Model Variant` | Choose between ConvNeXt or ViT variants of WD14 |
| `Batch Size` | Number of images to process at once |
| `Image Resize` | Resize shorter side of image before inference |
| `Caption Separator` | Character(s) used to join multiple tags |
| `Max Dataloader Workers` | Max number of workers to load images during tagging |

## Step 3: Run the Plugin

When executed, the plugin will:

- Load your image dataset
- Run the selected WD14 model on each image
- Generate tags/captions based on your thresholds
- Save the results as a new dataset with two columns:
  - `image` (original file path)
  - `caption` (generated tags)

## Output Example

| image | caption |
|-------|---------|
| `dog.png` | `1girl, dog, outdoors, tail wagging` |
| `cat.jpg` | `cat, lying down, looking at viewer` |

## Model Variants

- `wd-v1-4-convnext-tagger-v2.onnx`: More accurate, but larger
- `wd-v1-4-vit-tagger-v2.onnx`: Lightweight alternative

These models will be automatically downloaded and cached if not already present.
