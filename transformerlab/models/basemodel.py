class BaseModel:
    """
    A basic representation of a Model in Transformer Lab.

    The base object contains minimal information about the model
    so you can display a list of available models at low cost.
    If you want full model details in the format returned by the API
    (which maps to the structure of the database and model gallery)
    then you should call get_json_data().

    -- Creating additional Model sources --

    To add a new model source, you will typically create new classes
    that inherit from ModelStore and BaseModel.

    The key functions to override in your subclass are:
    - get_model_path:
    - get_json_data: to map model details to our standard json structure
    - install: ONLY if there is custom install actions required to run the model

    Then in your subclass' constructor call super, and then set any additional
    fields you want to store in the model's JSON.

    Properties:
    id:             Unique Transformer Lab model identifier
    name:           Printable name for the model (how it appears in the app)
    status:         A text string that is either "OK" or contains and error message
